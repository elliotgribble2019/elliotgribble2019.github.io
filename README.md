# Project 1: Predicting Next Day Stock Market Direction using a CNN on candlestick images
## Brief Overview
The project aimed to leverage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term
Memory Networks (LSTM) models for the analysis of candlestick patterns in stock market
data. The main objective is researching and developing three distinct image-based models
and one LSTM model:

1. Base-Case Model is a single model capable of recognizing candlestick patterns and
identifying industries; used as the baseline for performance and model comparison.

2. Super Sector Model incorporates a higher level industry classification of cyclical, defensive and sensitive and provides richer varieties of patterns to the image-based CNN
model.

3. Drawdown Protection Model specializes in capturing tail risk patterns and help clients
mitigate the risk of sudden market shocks.

4. LSTM Model is designed to compare with the base-case model to demonstrate how
significant the impact of the model choice could make.
